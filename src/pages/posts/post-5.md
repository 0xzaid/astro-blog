# Why am I starting this blog?
I just graduated from Monash University with a degree in Computer Science. My grades were okay, not outstanding, but I love software development & programming. One problem, though: I didn't do any extracurricular stuff, so I feel like I'm lagging behind others now that I'm out of university.

Then, out of the blue, I stumbled upon an article called Learn In Public, and it clicked with me. I've been feeling stuck and lost even after all the university years and personal projects.

I guess what I want is to push myself harder and take a good look at myself. By learning in public and writing about what I'm currently working on or learning, I hope it'll help me understand things better. The thought of someone else reading my blog is scary because I'm pretty private and don't like sharing much about myself.

# What will I do now?
From now on, I'll try to write one article every week about whatever I'm doing or learning. It could be about my interview preparation, leetcode challenges, random code stuff, or personal projects.

This learning in public thing might be nerve-wracking, but I hope it helps me become a better software developer and figure out things that have been confusing me so far. It's a big step, but I'm excited about the potential for growth and improvement.f
